### Bullet Time

[Bullet Time Camera Project](https://github.com/LJMU-SE/btns) - This project utilises a 360 array of Raspberry Pi's which capture images to be stitched into a video and
uses [frame interpolation](https://github.com/LJMU-SE/frame-interpolation) technology to extend fps. My main responsibilities for this project have been rapid prototyping of features and various other commits.

### Cold Frame

[Cold Frame](...) - The goal of this project is to build a self sustaining cold frame which utilises various sensors and an esp-32, and making changes to environment with various actuators depending on sensor readings
to maintain a specified environment.

### Bus Tracker

[Bus Tracker](...) - This project is ran on an esp-32 and displays the next bus at my local bus stop on an adafruits display.

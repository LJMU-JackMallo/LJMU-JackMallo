## Current

### Bullet Time ( In Development )

[Bullet Time Camera Project](https://github.com/LJMU-SE/btns) - This project utilises a 360 array of Raspberry Pi's which capture images to be stitched into a video and
uses [frame interpolation](https://github.com/LJMU-SE/frame-interpolation) technology to extend fps.

### Cold Frame

[Cold Frame](...) - This project aims to create a self-sustaining cold frame by integrating various sensors and an ESP-32 microcontroller. Through adjustments driven by sensor data, the system will employ a range of actuators to uphold a predefined environment within the cold frame.

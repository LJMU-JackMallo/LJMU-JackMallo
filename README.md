## Projects

Feel free to explore my repositories for projects related to my interests and university work.

## Current

### Bullet Time

[Bullet Time Camera Project](https://github.com/LJMU-SE/btns) - This project utilises a 360 array of Raspberry Pi's which capture images to be stitched into a video and
uses [frame interpolation](https://github.com/LJMU-SE/frame-interpolation) technology to extend fps. My main responsibilities for this project have been rapid prototyping of features and various other commits.

## Pending

### Cold Frame

[Cold Frame(Pending 2024)](...) - This project aims to create a self-sustaining cold frame by integrating various sensors and an ESP-32 microcontroller. Through adjustments driven by sensor data, the system employs a range of actuators to uphold a predefined environment within the cold frame.

### Bus Tracker

[Bus Tracker(Pending 2024)](...) - Operated on an ESP-32 platform, this project delivers real-time local bus schedules on an Adafruit display. Making use of the ESP-32's integrated WiFi capabilities, the system communicates with the Google Routes API for up-to-the-minute information.

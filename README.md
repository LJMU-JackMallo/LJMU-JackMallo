## Projects

Feel free to explore my repositories for projects related to my interests and university work.

## Current

## STEPPER MOTOR MUSIC
https://gitlab.com/JackMallo/motorious-b.o.t
Key Skills Developed: C++, Electronic Engineering, Arduino.

- Engineered a control system for stepper motors using Arduino Uno boards and a MIDI interface, allowing the
motors to produce specific musical notes based on step frequency.

- Developed system flexibility to enable the setup to play both pre-made MIDI tracks and live inputs from a MIDI
keyboard

## COLD FRAME MONITORING SYSTEM
https://gitlab.com/ljmu-csm/se-l4/2324-ljmu-coldframe-embeddedproject1
Key Skills Developed : C++, ESP-32, OOP, Electronic Engineering, Data Visualisation, Graphics.

- Implemented an object-oriented design to structure the project, promoting modularity of code for sensor
management and system control.

- Developed finite state machines within objects to encapsulate sensor behaviour, enabling responsive state
transitions based on sensor input.

- Enhanced system control capabilities by incorporating a rotary encoder, facilitating smooth navigation through
operating modes and adjustments to system settings.

## BULLET TIME PHOTOBOOTH
Key Skills Developed : Python, Technical Collaboration, Image Processing, Frame interpolation, Raspberry Pi.

- Implemented frame interpolation models to enhance the smoothness of transitions between frames.
  
- Leveraged asynchronous programming techniques to manage concurrent requests from a client to multiple
Raspberry Pis, facilitating synchronized image capture and reducing the risk of timing discrepancies.
